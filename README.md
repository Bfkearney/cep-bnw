Civ V: Communitas Expansion Pack (for BNW)

This project is organized in four parts:

- **Communitas Map** - This map creates several continents with realistic climate, and numerous offshore islands.

- **Communitas AI and Tools (Cat)** - Expands the AI and mod tools of Civ V: Brave New World. Both the expansion pack and interface changes below require the tools.

- **Communitas Enhanced Gameplay (Ceg)** - Improves the fun and strategic balance of BNW gameplay.

- **Communitas Interface (Cin)** - Improves the visual interface of the game. This will be cross-compatible between all expansions.
